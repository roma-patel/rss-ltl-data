austin	In the environment graph below (figure on the left), you will see two trajectories, one in blue and one in orange. This is an underlying graph where nodes are real-world landmarks in a map (e.g., figure of map on the right), and connections between nodes can be made to specify a trajectory to follow, as directed by arrows from the start to the end node. The blue trajectory is correct, while the orange is incorrect. Please give a natural language instruction that describes the blue trajectory and not the orange. Please do not refer to the colours (e.g., blue and orange trajectory) but to the landmarks as if they were in the real world. A list of landmarks that both trajectories go through is given on the right. The instruction you give will be given to an intelligent robot placed in the environment and asked to follow the instruction. Assume that the robot can correctly understand natural language and view the environment and landmarks around it.
